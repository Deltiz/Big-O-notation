# Big-O-notation
Develop a menu-driven program that evaluates the best, worst, and average
case performance of bubble sort, insertion sort, quick sort, linear search,
and binary search. Your front-end should be similar to the one shown in
Figure 1, invoking back-end functions to obtain performance results that
can be formatted for viewing in table format. Each table must include the
size of the underlying sequence being evaluated, real execution time, and
a justification for the correct big-O complexity by looking for convergence
when dividing by the right prediction [2]. For example, it appears that the
best-case of bubble sort is O(n) because the time column divided by the
size column converges to a constant. Similarly the worst-case appears to
be O(n2) because the time divided by squared size converges to a constant.
